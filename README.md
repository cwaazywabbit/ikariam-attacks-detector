# ikariam-attacks-detector

This script is part of a userscript that can be used with Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey in order to display a toast notification on the screen when a **new** hostile movement is detected. This is helpful during large battels when there are alot of moving parts that make it hard to notice new attacks.

This is ofcourse intended for use with Ikariam by Gameforge.
